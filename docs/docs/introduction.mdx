# Introduction

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:
- **Development**: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source [building blocks](/docs/concepts#langchain-expression-language) and [components](/docs/concepts). Hit the ground running using [third-party integrations](/docs/integrations/platforms/) and [Templates](/docs/templates).
- **Productionization**: Use [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith/) to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
- **Deployment**: Turn any chain into an API with [LangServe](/docs/langserve).

Concretely, the framework consists of the following open-source libraries:

- **`langchain-core`**: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.
- **`langchain-community`**: Third party integrations.
  - Partner packages (e.g. **`langchain-openai`**, **`langchain-anthropic`**, etc.): Some integrations have been further split into their own lightweight packages that only depend on **`langchain-core`**.
- **`langchain`**: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
- **[langgraph](/docs/langgraph)**: Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.
- **[langserve](/docs/langserve)**: Deploy LangChain chains as REST APIs.
- **[LangSmith](/docs/langsmith)**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications.
