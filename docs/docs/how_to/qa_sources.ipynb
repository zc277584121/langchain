    "We'll work off of the Q&A app we built over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post by Lilian Weng in the [RAG tutorial](/docs/tutorials/rag).\n",

    "1. Using the built-in [create_retrieval_chain](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.retrieval.create_retrieval_chain.html), which returns sources by default;\n",
