    "# How to handle long text when doing extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with files, like PDFs, you're likely to encounter text that exceeds your language model's context window. To process this text, consider these strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Change LLM** Choose a different LLM that supports a larger context window.\n",
    "2. **Brute Force** Chunk the document, and extract content from each chunk.\n",
    "3. **RAG** Chunk the document, index the chunks, and only extract content from a subset of chunks that look \"relevant\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that these strategies have different trade off and the best strategy likely depends on the application that you're designing!\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide demonstrates how to implement strategies 2 and 3."
