    "## UpTrain Callback Handler\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showcases the UpTrain callback handler seamlessly integrating into your pipeline, facilitating diverse evaluations. We have chosen a few evaluations that we deemed apt for evaluating the chains. These evaluations run automatically, with results displayed in the output. More details on UpTrain's evaluations can be found [here](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-built-evaluations-we-offer-). \n",
    "\n",
    "Selected retievers from Langchain are highlighted for demonstration:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Vanilla RAG**:\n",
    "RAG plays a crucial role in retrieving context and generating responses. To ensure its performance and response quality, we conduct the following evaluations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Context Relevance](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/context-awareness/context-relevance)**: Determines if the context extracted from the query is relevant to the response.\n",
    "- **[Factual Accuracy](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/context-awareness/factual-accuracy)**: Assesses if the LLM is hallcuinating or providing incorrect information.\n",
    "- **[Response Completeness](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/response-quality/response-completeness)**: Checks if the response contains all the information requested by the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Multi Query Generation**:\n",
    "MultiQueryRetriever creates multiple variants of a question having a similar meaning to the original question. Given the complexity, we include the previous evaluations and add:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Multi Query Accuracy](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/query-quality/multi-query-accuracy)**: Assures that the multi-queries generated mean the same as the original query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Context Compression and Reranking**:\n",
    "Re-ranking involves reordering nodes based on relevance to the query and choosing top n nodes. Since the number of nodes can reduce once the re-ranking is complete, we perform the following evaluations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Context Reranking](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/context-awareness/context-reranking)**: Checks if the order of re-ranked nodes is more relevant to the query than the original order.\n",
    "- **[Context Conciseness](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/context-awareness/context-conciseness)**: Examines whether the reduced number of nodes still provides all the required information.\n",
    "\n",
    "These evaluations collectively ensure the robustness and effectiveness of the RAG, MultiQueryRetriever, and the Reranking process in the chain."
