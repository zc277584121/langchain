# Qdrant

>[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/) (read: quadrant) is a vector similarity search engine. 
> It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage 
> points - vectors with an additional payload. `Qdrant` is tailored to extended filtering support.


## Installation and Setup

Install the Python partner package:

```bash
pip install langchain-qdrant
```


## Vector Store

There exists a wrapper around `Qdrant` indexes, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:
```python
from langchain_qdrant import Qdrant
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of the Qdrant wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/qdrant)
