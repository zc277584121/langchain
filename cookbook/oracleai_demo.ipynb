    "# Oracle AI Vector Search with Document Processing\n",
    "Oracle AI Vector Search is designed for Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads that allows you to query data based on semantics, rather than keywords.\n",
    "One of the biggest benefit of Oracle AI Vector Search is that semantic search on unstructured data can be combined with relational search on business data in one single system. This is not only powerful but also significantly more effective because you don't need to add a specialized vector database, eliminating the pain of data fragmentation between multiple systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, because Oracle has been building database technologies for so long, your vectors can benefit from all of Oracle Database's most powerful features, like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Partitioning Support\n",
    " * Real Application Clusters scalability\n",
    " * Exadata smart scans\n",
    " * Shard processing across geographically distributed databases\n",

    " * Oracle Graph Database\n",
    " * Oracle Spatial and Graph\n",
    " * Oracle Blockchain\n",
    " * JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide demonstrates how Oracle AI Vector Search can be used with Langchain to serve an end-to-end RAG pipeline. This guide goes through examples of:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Loading the documents from various sources using OracleDocLoader\n",
    " * Summarizing them within/outside the database using OracleSummary\n",
    " * Generating embeddings for them within/outside the database using OracleEmbeddings\n",
    " * Chunking them according to different requirements using Advanced Oracle Capabilities from OracleTextSplitter\n",
